                <p>ADHD or "Attention-deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder" is a psychiatric condition that affects children and adults. Those with this condition may display signs of having a limited attention span, high activity levels, and issues with organization and/or focus.</p>
                <p class="mb-0">Attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder can appear among girls than boys. Scientists have not yet identified the specific causes of ADHD but studies show there may be genetic and environmental links to it. When undiagnosed, people with ADHD can begin to find it difficult to complete everyday tasks or manage relationships. They may begin to blame themselves and develop low self-esteem. This can lead to other mental health issues such as depression or anxiety.</p>

                Eating Disorders. Eating disorders are when you might feel obsessively concerned about your body due to what you are eating. There is a large range of eating disorders. Types of eating disorders include; Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia Nervosa, Binge Eating Disorder, and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                Anorexia Nervosa, more commonly known as Anorexia, is not getting the number of calories you should for fear of gaining weight. People with eating disorders tend to be very reliant on their body weight and shape for their self-evaluation. Anorexia tends to begin during the younger years of life. Larger body people can have anorexia as well, but studies show due to cultural prejudice against fat and obesity it is less likely for it to be diagnosed to them.
                </p>
                <p>
                Bulimia Nervosa, more commonly known as bulimia, is recurrent episodes of binge eating and trying to make up for it by fasting, self-induced vomiting, too much exercise, or using laxatives. A person with bulimia tends to be worried about their weight, shape, or body image.
                </p>
                <p>
                Binge Eating Disorder is recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is eating an amount of food that is very large and having a lack of control over eating during that episode. An episode might be eating more rapidly than normal, eating until feeling uncomfortably full, eating large amounts of food when not hungry, eating alone because of embarrassment over how much one is eating and feel disgusted with oneself, depressed or very guilty afterward.

                <p> “Approximately, 1 in 5 adults in the U.S. - 43.8 million, experiences mental illness in a given year.” We only decided to focus on four, but there are many more that affect people in their every day lives. There are people everywhere that want to help. What we need to truly stop is ignorance. Mental health is greatly stigmatized in our present day and that needs to end. Gaining knowledge on this topic is the first step toward realizing the importance of a healthy mind.</p>
